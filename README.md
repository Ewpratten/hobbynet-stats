# Personal ASN Statistics

This repository contains some quickly thrown together scripts to generate the contents of [as-stats.ewpratten.com](https://as-stats.ewpratten.com).

The idea of this website is to periodically track what people are doing with their personal [Autonomous System Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)), from the good to the bad to the *wtf!?*
